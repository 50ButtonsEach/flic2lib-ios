 *
 *  @discussion     This identifier is guaranteed to be the same for each Flic paired to a particular iOS device. Thus it can be used to identify a Flic within an app.
 *                  However, If you need to identify Flics cross different apps on different iOS devices, then you should have look at the either uuid, serialNumber, or bluetoothAddress.

 *
 *  @discussion     The delegate that will receive events related to this particular Flic.

@property(nonatomic, readonly, strong, nullable) NSString *name;

/*!
 *  @property nickname
 *
 *  @discussion     With this property you can read out the display name that the user may change in for example the Flic app. This value can also be changed from third party apps
 *                  integrating this framework (including your app). The purpose of this is to provide more human readable name that the user can use to identify its Flic's across apps.
 *                  For example "Kitchen Flic" or "Bedroom Lights". The nickname has a maximum length limit of 23 bytes. Keep in mind that this is the length in bytes, and not the
 *                  number of UTF8 characters (which may be up to 4 bytes long). If you write anything longer than 23 bytes then the nickname will automatically be truncated to at
 *                  most 23 bytes. When truncating the string, the framework will always cut between UTF8 character, so you don't have to worry about writing half an emoji, for example.

/*!
 *  @property serialNumber
 *
 *  @discussion     The serial number is a production identifier that is printed on the backside of the Flic inside the battery hatch.
 *                  This serves no other purpose than allowing a user to identify a button by manually looking at it. Can be useful in some cases.

/*!
 *  @property triggerMode
 *
 *  @discussion     Use this property to let the flic2lib know what type of click events you are interested it. By default you will get Click, Double Click and Hold events.
 *                  However, if you for example are only interested in Click events then you can set this property to FLICButtonTriggerModeClick. Doing so will allow the flic2lib to
 *                  deliver the events quicker since it can now ignore Double Click and Hold.

 *
 *  @discussion     When a Flic connects it will go through a quick cryptographic verification to ensure that it is both a genuine Flic and that it is the correct Flic.
 *                  Once this is completed this property will be set to YES and it is not until after that that you will start receiving click events (if any). As soon as the button disconnects
 *                  this will be set to NO again.

/*!
 *  @property batteryVoltage
 *
 *  @discussion     This will be the last know battery sample taken on the Flic. If this value is 0 then you should assume that no sample has yet been taken. It is important to know that
 *                  the voltage may fluctuate depending on many different factors, such as temperature and workload. For example, heavy usage of the LED will temporarily lower the voltage,
 *                  but it is likely to recover shortly after. Therefore we do not recomend to exactly translate this value into a battery percentage, instead consider showing a
 *                  "change the battery soon"-status in your app once the voltage goes below 2.65V.

/*!

 *                  or if the maximum number of pairings have been reached. In this case you will need to delete the button from the manager and then scan for it again.

 *  @discussion     Lets you switch between two different latency modes. For most use-cases it is recommend to keep the default FLICLatencyModeNormal.
 *                  FLICLatencyModeLow should ideally only be used for foreground applications, such as games, where low latency is needed. Keep in mind that the
 *                  energy consumption will be significantly higher in the low latency mode.
